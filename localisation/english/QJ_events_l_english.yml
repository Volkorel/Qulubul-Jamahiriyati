 jam_world.1.d:0 "In the heart of Cordoba, under a canopy of darkness punctuated only by the transient glow of musket fire echoing in the night, a hush fell over the cityscape. Amidst this chaos, the esteemed banner of the Republic of Cordoba was solemnly brought down, making way for the emerging banner of the Andalusian populace. This new symbol, set against a backdrop as white as milk, was adorned with inscriptions in a rich brown hue that sang praises to unity amongst our Arab brethren.\n\nThe mastermind believed to be behind this seismic shift, Major-General Ismail ibn Hashim, stepped forth as the messenger of this new dawn. With words measured yet laden with an uncanny power, he announced that this upheaval was none other than the physical manifestation of the collective will and passion of our Andalusian kin. He argued that such a move was necessitated by our current reality—a bold stance to counter threats from both Carlist and Spanish monarchist factions. In his oration, Major-General Ismail ibn Hashim emphasized that securing Andalusia's safety and sovereignty was paramount amidst these turbulent political seas.\n\n"

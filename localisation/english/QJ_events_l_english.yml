 jam_world.1.t:0 "Bayonets Waved!"
 jam_world.1.d:0 "In the heart of Cordoba, under a canopy of darkness punctuated only by the transient glow of musket fire echoing in the night, a hush fell over the cityscape. Amidst this chaos, the esteemed banner of the Republic of Cordoba was solemnly brought down, making way for the emerging banner of the Andalusian populace. This new symbol, set against a backdrop as white as milk, was adorned with inscriptions in a rich brown hue that sang praises to unity amongst our Arab brethren.\n\nThe mastermind believed to be behind this seismic shift, Major-General Ismail ibn Hashim, stepped forth as the messenger of this new dawn. With words measured yet laden with an uncanny power, he announced that this upheaval was none other than the physical manifestation of the collective will and passion of our Andalusian kin. He argued that such a move was necessitated by our current reality—a bold stance to counter threats from both Carlist and Spanish monarchist factions. In his oration, Major-General Ismail ibn Hashim emphasized that securing Andalusia's safety and sovereignty was paramount amidst these turbulent political seas.\n\n"
 jam_world.1.a:0 "Shimmering between hillocks."
 
 jam_world.2.t:0 "Insurrection in the Seljuk Sultanate!"
 jam_world.2.d:0 "Chaos reigns in Yeniçeşme as an ultranationalist uprising, being termed the \"Arslan Insurrection\", has launched a savage assault on the city’s Legation Quarter. The insurrectionists, purportedly loyal to Sultan Keyhüsrev II, denounce foreign influence in the Sultanate, and have embarked on a campaign of terror.\n\nThe Legation Quarter, home to embassies of Vinland, Frankia, Bretonnia, Nikisetokako, Bavaria-Mariaföld, Frij Fryslan, Gardaveldi, and Japan, is now a bastion of resistance. Foreign residents and non-Muslim citizens have sought refuge there, fearing indiscriminate massacres by the insurrectionists.\n\nReports confirm widespread atrocities in the city, with entire neighborhoods ransacked and innocent lives lost. The foreign powers, determined to defend their citizens, are swiftly mobilizing forces to break the siege.\n\nThe Sultanate’s response remains unclear. Whether Keyhüsrev II condones or condemns the insurrection remains a matter of grave speculation. With tensions mounting, Yeniçeşme teeters on the brink of catastrophe.\n\n"
 jam_world.2.a:0 "And do not consider the ignorant ones as real men, nor the untalented ones as knowledgeable."
 
 jam_world.3.t:0 "Seljuks Sign Treaty with the Eight Nations!"
 jam_world.3.d:0 "After seventy harrowing days of siege, the Legation Quarter of Yeniçeşme stands triumphant, its defenders bolstered by the resolve and reinforcements of the Eight-Nation Alliance. The Arslan Insurrection has been decisively crushed, and Sultan Keyhüsrev II, under international pressure, has signed a punitive treaty ensuring peace. The terms are severe but just. Reparations will be paid to each aggrieved power, treasonous officials who abetted the uprising have faced execution, and the foreign presence in Yeniçeşme has been cemented with fortified embassies and expanded concessions. The Sultanate's acquiescence marks a resounding victory for the international civilized order.\n\nCelebration sweeps through the Legation Quarter. Vinlandic mead flows freely alongside Gardaveldic ales; Mariafölders and Japanese share hearty laughter, while Greeks and Suid-Afrikans join hands in jubilant dances. The camaraderie of the Eight Nations shines as a beacon of harmony and cooperation, proof that diverse peoples can unite in the face of barbarism. This triumph has inspired hope that the 20th century will be an era of enduring peace, driven by shared values and mutual respect among the great powers.\n\n"
 jam_world.3.a:0 "And thus he spoke: \"Alas! Alas! Thy drums are hushed, thy larums have rung truce.\""
 
 jam_world.4.t:0 "Foreigners Expelled from the Seljuk Sultanate!"
 jam_world.4.d:0 "In cities across the Seljuk Sultanate, the same scene plays out: foreigners, Christians, Jews, and pagans alike are driven out of their homes and slaughtered by the vengeful mob. Churches, homes, and legations are put to the torch. Shops are ransacked. Men and women are lured in by a bey's promise of safety, only to face beheading by his guards' swords. No protections in Islamic or secular law can save these people from the wrath of the spurned Turks, who have declared an end to their humiliation by the imperial powers. Many of the great powers' navies have been dispatched, attempting to evacuate their citizens and the other refugees, yet with limited time and capacity, thousands must be left to their fates on the shore.\n\nThe following day, the corpses are cleared from the streets. In the next few months, the destroyed districts will be rebuilt for Turkish residents and businesses. For years to come, the Sultanate will be closed off to outsiders - isolated, but stable. The Seljuks have taken control of their own destiny, paying the price in foreigners' blood.\n\n"
 jam_world.4.a:0 "When the drums beat, hearts swell and desires rise!"
 
 jam_world.5.t:0 "War of the Generals"
 jam_world.5.d:0 "A bloody civil war has ignited within the Italian Federation, pitting two of the nation's most prominent military leaders against one another. General Ferruccio Cesario, a staunch Duemarist, has launched his long-anticipated \"March on Rome,\" challenging the authority of Emmanuel Luigi Aonzo, leader of the military Junta and celebrated war hero.\n\nThe conflict, already being dubbed the \"War of the Generals,\" draws its inspiration from recent events in Siqiliyya, where Duemarist protestors overthrew the government following claims of election fraud, rallying behind the charismatic leader Ibrahim Yousouf ibn Mukhtar. The Siqiliyyan prime minister has now pledged his full support for Cesario, sending military forces to bolster the general’s cause.\n\nDuemarist propagandists are already hailing this union of Arab Siqiliyyans and Italian nationals as a symbol of their shared cultural and historical ties. Duemarists claim this to be the first step in the unification of Italy and the Maghreb; the \"Two Seas.\" in Duemarist ideology.\n\n"
 jam_world.5.a:0 "Hic sunt leones, alea iacta est!"
 
 jam_world.6.t:0 "The Italian Reconciliation"
 jam_world.6.d:0 "The devastating civil war within the Italian Federation has officially come to a close, as generals Emmanuel Luigi Aonzo and Ferruccio Cesario reached a historic compromise. After weeks of fierce conflict, Aonzo, a proud nationalist, has agreed to allow the Duemarists into power, stating that there can be \"no more brother wars\" in the face of foreign threats.\n\nAonzo, who once sought to preserve Italy’s independence through the military Junta, was persuaded by Cesario’s assurances that the Duemarists could restore Italy’s former glory. A key factor in the agreement was the Duemarist promise to avenge the humiliation of the Treaty of Azov, in which the foreign power of Nikisetokako claimed Siqiliyya and the Italians were banned from passing through the Jabal Tariq strait and the Suez Canal, trapping their navy and trade vessels in the Mediterranean.\n\nNow, the Italian military stands united under Duemarist leadership, with eyes set on expanding Italy's influence by reuniting with the northern Italian states and the Maghreb.\n\n"
 jam_world.6.a:0 "Aut Cesario aut nihil!"
 
 jam_world.7.t:0 "Savoyards Seize Frankish Border Territories!"
 jam_world.7.d:0 "In a bold and unexpected move, the Kingdom of Savoy has successfully captured key border regions from the Republic of Frankia. This audacious military action was carried out by a secretive group known as the \"Silky and Daring Ones,\" composed of exiled Frankish nobles who fled their homeland following the Jacobin Revolution.\n\nThe Kingdom of Savoy, staunchly anti-republican and fervently dedicated to the preservation of monarchical rule, has heralded this as a major victory in their crusade to restore traditional monarchy and defend the last independent Frankish kingdom. Savoy’s monarchists claim the victory as a triumph over the forces of republicanism that have gripped much of Europe.\n\nRemarkably, the success has even garnered support from Italy’s Duemarists, who, despite their republican ideology, view Savoy's actions as a victory for the Italian people.\n\n"
 jam_world.7.a:0 "Together we will be reborn, on the morning of a better day..."
 
 jam_world.8.t:0 "Franks Defeat Savoyard Incursion!"
 jam_world.8.d:0 "The Republic of Frankia has decisively repelled an assault by the Kingdom of Savoy, retaining its territorial integrity in full. The attackers, known as the \"Silky and Daring Ones,\" were a coalition of exiled Frankish nobles and their private armies, who aimed to capture crucial border regions on behalf of the Savoyard king.\n\nIn a statement delivered before the National Assembly, President Pierre-Isaïe Asselineau hailed the victory as a triumph for the republican cause, declaring, \"The forces of feudal despotism have once again been broken against the will of a free people.\"\n\nGrowing calls within Frankia urge for a full war against Savoy, in order to extinguish the last bastion of \"decadent feudalism\" and finish the unification of Frankia. Meanwhile, the rest of the world looks on with unease, fearing the potential for this to escalate into a major European war.\n\n"
 jam_world.8.a:0 "Halte là! On ne passe pas!"
 
 jam_world.9.t:0 "Frankia Declares War on Savoy!"
 jam_world.9.d:0 "The Republic of Frankia has formally declared war on the Kingdom of Savoy, marking a dramatic escalation in tensions that have gripped Europe in recent months. In a fiery address to the National Assembly, President Pierre-Isaïe Asselineau denounced Savoy’s harboring of exiled nobles and its recent military provocations, vowing to \"eradicate the last vestige of feudal oppression from Frankish soil.\"\n\nQueen Eutalia II, for her part, has called the declaration an act of aggression, asserting Savoy's right to sovereignty and accusing Frankia of pursuing expansionist aims under the guise of republicanism.\n\nThe conflict has sent ripples through the continent, with both nations calling upon their allies to honor their promises of support and join the war.\n\nAs both armies mobilize, the specter of battle looms over the Alps, with Europe left to watch as the peace of the 20th century is already slipping away.\n\n"

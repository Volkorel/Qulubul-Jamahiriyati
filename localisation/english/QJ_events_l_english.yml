 jam_world.1.t:0 "Bayonets Waved!"
 jam_world.1.d:0 "In the heart of Cordoba, under a canopy of darkness punctuated only by the transient glow of musket fire echoing in the night, a hush fell over the cityscape. Amidst this chaos, the esteemed banner of the Republic of Cordoba was solemnly brought down, making way for the emerging banner of the Andalusian populace. This new symbol, set against a backdrop as white as milk, was adorned with inscriptions in a rich brown hue that sang praises to unity amongst our Arab brethren.\n\nThe mastermind believed to be behind this seismic shift, Major-General Ismail ibn Hashim, stepped forth as the messenger of this new dawn. With words measured yet laden with an uncanny power, he announced that this upheaval was none other than the physical manifestation of the collective will and passion of our Andalusian kin. He argued that such a move was necessitated by our current reality—a bold stance to counter threats from both Carlist and Spanish monarchist factions. In his oration, Major-General Ismail ibn Hashim emphasized that securing Andalusia's safety and sovereignty was paramount amidst these turbulent political seas.\n\n"
 jam_world.1.a:0 "Shimmering between hillocks."
 
 jam_world.2.t:0 "Insurrection in the Seljuk Sultanate!"
 jam_world.2.d:0 "Chaos reigns in Yeniçeşme as an ultranationalist uprising, being termed the \"Arslan Insurrection\", has launched a savage assault on the city’s Legation Quarter. The insurrectionists, purportedly loyal to Sultan Keyhüsrev II, denounce foreign influence in the Sultanate, and have embarked on a campaign of terror.\n\nThe Legation Quarter, home to embassies of Vinland, Frankia, Bretonnia, Nikisetokako, Bavaria-Mariaföld, Frij Fryslan, Gardaveldi, and Japan, is now a bastion of resistance. Foreign residents and non-Muslim citizens have sought refuge there, fearing indiscriminate massacres by the insurrectionists.\n\nReports confirm widespread atrocities in the city, with entire neighborhoods ransacked and innocent lives lost. The foreign powers, determined to defend their citizens, are swiftly mobilizing forces to break the siege.\n\nThe Sultanate’s response remains unclear. Whether Keyhüsrev II condones or condemns the insurrection remains a matter of grave speculation. With tensions mounting, Yeniçeşme teeters on the brink of catastrophe.\n\n"
 jam_world.2.a:0 "And do not consider the ignorant ones as real men, nor the untalented ones as knowledgeable."
 
 jam_world.3.t:0 "Seljuks Sign Treaty with the Eight Nations!"
 jam_world.3.d:0 "After seventy harrowing days of siege, the Legation Quarter of Yeniçeşme stands triumphant, its defenders bolstered by the resolve and reinforcements of the Eight-Nation Alliance. The Arslan Insurrection has been decisively crushed, and Sultan Keyhüsrev II, under international pressure, has signed a punitive treaty ensuring peace. The terms are severe but just. Reparations will be paid to each aggrieved power, treasonous officials who abetted the uprising have faced execution, and the foreign presence in Yeniçeşme has been cemented with fortified embassies and expanded concessions. The Sultanate's acquiescence marks a resounding victory for the international civilized order.\n\nCelebration sweeps through the Legation Quarter. Vinlandic mead flows freely alongside Gardaveldic ales; Mariafölders and Japanese share hearty laughter, while Greeks and Suid-Afrikans join hands in jubilant dances. The camaraderie of the Eight Nations shines as a beacon of harmony and cooperation, proof that diverse peoples can unite in the face of barbarism. This triumph has inspired hope that the 20th century will be an era of enduring peace, driven by shared values and mutual respect among the great powers.\n\n"
 jam_world.3.a:0 "And thus he spoke: \"Alas! Alas! Thy drums are hushed, thy larums have rung truce.\""
 
 jam_world.4.t:0 "Foreigners Expelled from the Seljuk Sultanate!"
 jam_world.4.d:0 "In cities across the Seljuk Sultanate, the same scene plays out: foreigners, Christians, Jews, and pagans alike are driven out of their homes and slaughtered by the vengeful mob. Churches, homes, and legations are put to the torch. Shops are ransacked. Men and women are lured in by a bey's promise of safety, only to face beheading by his guards' swords. No protections in Islamic or secular law can save these people from the wrath of the spurned Turks, who have declared an end to their humiliation by the imperial powers. Many of the great powers' navies have been dispatched, attempting to evacuate their citizens and the other refugees, yet with limited time and capacity, thousands must be left to their fates on the shore.\n\nThe following day, the corpses are cleared from the streets. In the next few months, the destroyed districts will be rebuilt for Turkish residents and businesses. For years to come, the Sultanate will be closed off to outsiders - isolated, but stable. The Seljuks have taken control of their own destiny, paying the price in foreigners' blood.\n\n"
 jam_world.4.a:0 "When the drums beat, hearts swell and desires rise!"
 
 jam_world.5.t:0 "War of the Generals"
 jam_world.5.d:0 "A bloody civil war has ignited within the Italian Federation, pitting two of the nation's most prominent military leaders against one another. General Ferruccio Cesario, a staunch Duemarist, has launched his long-anticipated \"March on Rome,\" challenging the authority of Emmanuel Luigi Aonzo, leader of the military Junta and celebrated war hero.\n\nThe conflict, already being dubbed the \"War of the Generals,\" draws its inspiration from recent events in Siqiliyya, where Duemarist protestors overthrew the government following claims of election fraud, rallying behind the charismatic leader Ibrahim Yousouf ibn Mukhtar. The Siqiliyyan prime minister has now pledged his full support for Cesario, sending military forces to bolster the general’s cause.\n\nDuemarist propagandists are already hailing this union of Arab Siqiliyyans and Italian nationals as a symbol of their shared cultural and historical ties. Duemarists claim this to be the first step in the unification of Italy and the Maghreb; the \"Two Seas.\" in Duemarist ideology.\n\n"
 jam_world.5.a:0 "Hic sunt leones, alea iacta est!"
 
 jam_world.6.t:0 "The Italian Reconciliation"
 jam_world.6.d:0 "The devastating civil war within the Italian Federation has officially come to a close, as generals Emmanuel Luigi Aonzo and Ferruccio Cesario reached a historic compromise. After weeks of fierce conflict, Aonzo, a proud nationalist, has agreed to allow the Duemarists into power, stating that there can be \"no more brother wars\" in the face of foreign threats.\n\nAonzo, who once sought to preserve Italy’s independence through the military Junta, was persuaded by Cesario’s assurances that the Duemarists could restore Italy’s former glory. A key factor in the agreement was the Duemarist promise to avenge the humiliation of the Treaty of Azov, in which the foreign power of Nikisetokako claimed Siqiliyya and the Italians were banned from passing through the Jabal Tariq strait and the Suez Canal, trapping their navy and trade vessels in the Mediterranean.\n\nNow, the Italian military stands united under Duemarist leadership, with eyes set on expanding Italy's influence by reuniting with the northern Italian states and the Maghreb.\n\n"
 jam_world.6.a:0 "Aut Cesario aut nihil!"
 
 jam_world.7.t:0 "Savoyards Seize Frankish Border Territories!"
 jam_world.7.d:0 "In a bold and unexpected move, the Kingdom of Savoy has successfully captured key border regions from the Republic of Frankia. This audacious military action was carried out by a secretive group known as the \"Silky and Daring Ones,\" composed of exiled Frankish nobles who fled their homeland following the Jacobin Revolution.\n\nThe Kingdom of Savoy, staunchly anti-republican and fervently dedicated to the preservation of monarchical rule, has heralded this as a major victory in their crusade to restore traditional monarchy and defend the last independent Frankish kingdom. Savoy’s monarchists claim the victory as a triumph over the forces of republicanism that have gripped much of Europe.\n\nRemarkably, the success has even garnered support from Italy’s Duemarists, who, despite their republican ideology, view Savoy's actions as a victory for the Italian people.\n\n"
 jam_world.7.a:0 "Together we will be reborn, on the morning of a better day..."
 
 jam_world.8.t:0 "Franks Defeat Savoyard Incursion!"
 jam_world.8.d:0 "The Republic of Frankia has decisively repelled an assault by the Kingdom of Savoy, retaining its territorial integrity in full. The attackers, known as the \"Silky and Daring Ones,\" were a coalition of exiled Frankish nobles and their private armies, who aimed to capture crucial border regions on behalf of the Savoyard king.\n\nIn a statement delivered before the National Assembly, President Pierre-Isaïe Asselineau hailed the victory as a triumph for the republican cause, declaring, \"The forces of feudal despotism have once again been broken against the will of a free people.\"\n\nGrowing calls within Frankia urge for a full war against Savoy, in order to extinguish the last bastion of \"decadent feudalism\" and finish the unification of Frankia. Meanwhile, the rest of the world looks on with unease, fearing the potential for this to escalate into a major European war.\n\n"
 jam_world.8.a:0 "Halte là! On ne passe pas!"
 
 jam_world.9.t:0 "Frankia Declares War on Savoy!"
 jam_world.9.d:0 "The Republic of Frankia has formally declared war on the Kingdom of Savoy, marking a dramatic escalation in tensions that have gripped Europe in recent months. In a fiery address to the National Assembly, President Pierre-Isaïe Asselineau denounced Savoy’s harboring of exiled nobles and its recent military provocations, vowing to \"eradicate the last vestige of feudal oppression from Frankish soil.\"\n\nQueen Eutalia II, for her part, has called the declaration an act of aggression, asserting Savoy's right to sovereignty and accusing Frankia of pursuing expansionist aims under the guise of republicanism.\n\nThe conflict has sent ripples through the continent, with both nations calling upon their allies to honor their promises of support and join the war.\n\nAs both armies mobilize, the specter of battle looms over the Alps, with Europe left to watch as the peace of the 20th century is already slipping away.\n\n"
 jam_world.9.a:0 "Come on, friend, let's weep together, waiting for a better future..."
 
 jam_world.10.t:0 "Terror in the Heart of Darkness!"
 jam_world.10.d:0 "The colonial outpost in Vinlandic Somalia was astir yesterday as Frysk explorer Atsert Gerbrandy staggered into the settlement with an astonishing tale of discovery and peril deep in the uncharted African interior. Gerbrandy, bedraggled and visibly shaken, recounted his encounter with a mysterious kingdom of pygmies, ruled by a figure known as \"Ínà Mapiti\", or \"The Black Leopard\". According to his account, the diminutive warriors of this realm are fearsome combatants and fanatically expansionist, subjugating neighboring tribes in unrelenting campaigns of conquest. Most troubling, Gerbrandy warned, is their vehement hatred for Europeans.\n\nCaptured by the warriors and brought before their enigmatic king, Gerbrandy narrowly escaped execution. \"Their king's gaze was piercing, as though he could see through one’s soul,\" he said. \"I would not be standing here if not for fortune’s grace.\"\n\nColonial officials are taking Gerbrandy’s account seriously, viewing this mysterious kingdom as a potential threat to colonial interests in the region.\n\n"
 jam_world.10.a:0 "Horrid! Such terror only reinforces the need for a civilizing mission."
 
 jam_world.11.t:0 "Revolutionary Factions Rise Against Emperor Hongguang!"
 jam_world.11.d:0 "The once-mighty Penglai Empire, long beset by internal strife and the creeping decay of central authority, now teeters on the precipice of total collapse. In a dramatic turn of events, regional governors across the empire have openly defied the imperial court in Dadong, declaring their intent to overthrow Emperor Hongguang and establish new regimes.\n\nThree formidable revolutionary armies have emerged, each espousing distinct ideologies: The National Revolutionary Council, led by the fiery Jacobin Lu Jiyao; the Tufeilingdi Army, under the command of the socialist Yanmin Jialie; and the Southern Revolutionary Army, guided by Zhao Long, which embraces corporatism, authoritarianism, and xenophobic populism.\n\nThough only minor clashes have thus far erupted, the empire braces for the inevitable storm as these factions prepare to march on Dadong. All the while, Frysk settlers in the north have banded together into militias, seeking to defend the land that they now see as their own. The international community watches with bated breath, for the fall of Penglai could reshape the balance of power in North Eriksland.\n\n"
 jam_world.11.a:0 "Warlordism followed the Chinese to Eriksland, it seems..."
 
 jam_world.12.t:0 "The Jiyou Uprising"
 jam_world.12.d:0 "The simmering tensions within the Penglai Empire have erupted into full-scale war, as the revolutionary factions—long at odds with the imperial throne—have launched a coordinated invasion of the territories still loyal to Emperor Hongguang. The empire, once a bastion of stability, now convulses under the weight of the "Jiyou Uprising," a name drawn from the label for 1909 in the traditional Chinese calendar, marking this year as one of reckoning.\n\nFrom the windswept deserts of the interior to the verdant forests of the coast, the clash of arms echoes across every corner of Penglai. The National Revolutionary Council, the Tufeilingdi Army, and the Southern Revolutionary Army vie fiercely to outpace one another in their race to seize Dadong and topple the emperor. Meanwhile, the imperial forces, though outnumbered and outmaneuvered, mount a desperate defense, determined to preserve the old dynasty. Meanwhile, on the far north-western frontier of the Empire, Frysk separatists fight against each of the other involved factions, in a bid to secure territory for an independent \"New Zion\"\n\n"

 jam_world.13.t:0 "Imperial Rule Restored in Penglai!" #Imperials
 jam_world.13.d:0 "In a stunning reversal of fortune, the beleaguered Imperial forces of Penglai have emerged victorious in the bloody Jiyou Uprising, crushing the revolutionary armies that sought to dismantle the old dynasty. The once-fractured empire now stands reunited under the banner of the child Emperor Hongguang, whose court of eunuchs and regents now wield true power from the halls of Dadong.\n\nThe revolutionary factions—Lu Jiyao’s Jacobins, Yanmin Jialie’s socialists, and Zhao Long’s Duemarists—have been decisively routed, their dreams of a new order extinguished in the face of imperial might. With the warlords subdued and the provinces brought to heel, the eunuch regents have begun consolidating their authority, promising a return to stability and tradition.\n\nYet, whispers abound that this hard-won peace may be fragile. The eunuchs, though loyal to the throne, are said to harbor ambitions of their own, and the empire’s weary populace remains divided. As the dust settles, the world watches to see whether this restored empire will endure—or whether the seeds of rebellion still linger beneath the surface.\n\n"

 jam_world.14.t:0 "Penglai Republic Declared!" #Jacobins
 jam_world.14.d:0 "In a dramatic climax to the Jiyou Uprising, the Jacobin forces led by the indomitable Lu Jiyao have seized Dadong, toppling the imperial regime and proclaiming the birth of the Republic of Penglai. The child Emperor Hongguang, captured in the final hours of the conflict, has been spared the wrath of the revolutionaries, who have vowed to raise him as a common citizen in their new egalitarian order.\n\nThe Jacobins’ victory marks the end of centuries of imperial rule, as Penglai embraces anti-monarchist ideals with fervor. Lu Jiyao’s forces, through a combination of battlefield prowess and shrewd diplomacy, have subdued the rival revolutionary factions.\n\nYet, the birth of this republic has sent ripples of unease across the region, particularly in Penglai's northern neighbor, the Kingdom of Vinland. As Penglai embarks on this bold experiment in governance, the world watches with a mixture of hope and trepidation, wondering whether this new republic will endure—or succumb to the challenges of its revolutionary birth.\n\n"

 jam_world.15.d:0 "In a historic turn of events, a coalition of revolutionary factions has emerged victorious in the Jiyou Uprising, capturing Dadong and proclaiming the establishment of the Republic of Penglai. Through a remarkable compromise, the revolutionary factions have set aside their differences to forge a united government, marking the end of the imperial era.\n\nThe first elections of the fledgling republic have yielded a coalition government led by the Communist Party of Penglai, with Yanmin Jialie at its helm. This unprecedented alliance has pledged to uphold anti-monarchist ideals and build a new society rooted in equality and cooperation.\n\nThe child Emperor Hongguang, captured during the fall of Dadong, has been absolved of blame for the empire’s decline. The revolutionaries have vowed to raise him as a citizen of the republic, free from the trappings of his former station.\n\nThe birth of this republic has stirred unease in the Kingdom of Vinland, where monarchist leaders view its anti-royalist fervor with suspicion.\n\n"

After a grueling campaign, the Tufeilingdi Army captured Dadong, securing their dominance over rival factions and ending centuries of imperial rule.\n\nThe child Emperor Hongguang, taken into custody during the final days of the conflict, has been absolved of blame for the empire’s misrule, with the revolutionaries pledging to raise him as an equal citizen in their new proletarian state. Yanmin Jialie, now the undisputed leader of Penglai, has vowed to dismantle the old order and usher in an era of class equality and collective governance.\n\nThe birth of this socialist republic has sent shockwaves across the region, particularly in the Kingdom of Vinland, where fears of revolutionary ideals spreading northward have gripped the monarchy. As Penglai embarks on this radical transformation, the world watches with a mix of curiosity and apprehension, wondering whether this bold experiment will flourish or falter.\n\n"

 jam_world.18.d:0 "In a decisive turn of events, the Southern Revolutionary Army, led by the charismatic Zhao Long, has emerged victorious in the Jiyou Uprising, capturing Dadong and proclaiming the establishment of the State of Great Dadong. The new regime, rooted in Duemarist ideals, has declared its commitment to populist and xenophobic policies, vowing to purge Penglai of foreign influence and restore its national pride.\n\nThe child Emperor Hongguang, taken into custody during the final throes of the conflict, has been spared retribution, with the revolutionaries pledging to mold him into a fervent opponent of foreign encroachment. Zhao Long’s forces, through a combination of military might and political maneuvering, have subdued rival factions, securing their dominance over the fractured empire.\n\nThe rise of this fiercely nationalistic state has alarmed neighboring nations, particularly the Kingdom of Vinland, where fears of escalating tensions and anti-foreign sentiment loom large. As the State of Great Dadong consolidates its power, the world watches warily, uncertain of what this new chapter will bring for Penglai and Eriksland as a whole.\n\n"

 QJ_penglai.2.d:0 "Subject: Escalating Unrest in Penglai\n\nThe Penglai Empire faces imminent collapse as regional warlords openly defy the central government in Dadong. The child Emperor Hongguang, under the regency of court eunuchs, lacks the authority to quell the growing insubordination. Warlords now operate as de facto independent rulers, and revolutionary sentiments are spreading rapidly.\n\nWe recommend that Vinland must prioritize safeguarding Lantang, an autonomous city critical to our economic interests. Its strategic location and trade networks are vital to maintaining our influence in the region.\n\nWe additionally recommend propping up the Penglai monarchy, to prevent the rise of a radical state on our border, ensuring regional stability. Alternatively, supporting Frysk independence in Nij Sion could create a loyal satellite state, weakening Penglai’s potential resurgence and providing a buffer against future threats.\n\nThe situation demands swift action.

Thus, we recommend an effort to prop up the imperial regime, in order to preserve  these ties and ensure economic stability.\n\nIt should also be noted that a radical state emerging in Penglai could inspire unrest among Langobardia’s slave population, jeopardizing domestic security. Bolstering the imperial government would mitigate this risk.\n\nImmediate action is advised to secure Langobardia’s economic and political interests. The Wītnessambaht recommends allocating resources to stabilize the Penglai monarchy and counter revolutionary threats.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nTheodoric Wahrman, Director of the Wītnessambaht"

Regional warlords flout the authority of Dadong, and the child Emperor Hongguang is a mere puppet, unable to halt the empire’s disintegration. Revolutionary factions — the National Revolutionary Council (Jacobin), the Tufeilingdi Army (Socialist), and the Southern Revolutionary Army (Duemarist) — are poised to dismantle the monarchy. This is a moment of profound opportunity for Gardavelði to advance its revolutionary ideals and strike a blow against monarchist tyranny.\n\nWe recommend that we should align with a faction that best reflects our principles. Once we are committed to one of the Republican factions, they may receive our covert support to accelerate the monarchy’s downfall.\n\nThe time to act is now.
